# Introduction
### The Book ‘The SAGE Handbook of Social Network Analysis by John Scott was published in November 2018. The book consists of 38 articles, each with a separate author. Chapter 1, ‘Crime and Social Network Analysis’  is chosen as the theme of this paper, the author of this article is Peter J. Carrington. 
&emsp;
### Although some people say that the 21st century is a civilized society and people are safer and happier than in the past, crime still exists. Can a person commit a crime for no reason? The answer is no. The point of this paper is that crime is closely related to social networks, and personal networks have a great impact on crime and lawbreaking.

&emsp;
# Summary
### The author divides this paper into three subject areas: individual network, neighborhood network, and criminal network, and analyzes the three subject areas and criminal behavior respectively.

### The author argues that the study on the etiology of crimes needs to be analyzed from two levels. One is at the individual level, the other is at the community level. At the individual level, the author cites three theories, Differential association theory, Social control theory, and Krohn's cybercrime theory.
&emsp;
### Differences association theory thought is, that everyone has different ways of contact with the external experience, when a person is exposed to the definition of crime definition and against crime, criminal behavior is likely to happen, Therefore, the authors wrote in the theory of the narrative “criminal attitudes and behavior are not innate, but are learned from”. This also leads to two consequences of the theory, social learning and peer influence which, according to the authors, has been identified in later studies as the principal proximate cause of most criminal behavior
&emsp;
### The second theory mentioned in the paper is the social control theory proposed by Hirschi, which is opposite to the Differences Association theory mentioned above. The theory is that people are born with antisocial, criminal, deviant behavior. “This is in clear contrast with differential association theory, which characterizes both delinquents and nondelinquents as being embedded in peer and family networks but with differing normative balances.” The author argues that although the two theories contradict each other, they both promote the study of social networks.
&emsp;
### Meanwhile, the final theory is Krohn's network theory of delinquency. As the name suggests, the theory was developed by Krohn. The theory is a combination of differential Association theory and social control theory. "The social cohesion of ego s network, as indicated by its multiplexity and density, affects both ego s social integration (as in social control theory) and the balance of influences of procriminal and  anticriminal definitions in the network (as in differential association theory) "the author wrote.
&emsp;
### Later, the author also analyzed the composition of crimes at the individual level, based on interviews with people from different countries, genders, and ages around the world.  According to the article, the influence of friends on individual criminal behavior is greater than that of parents. And the difference between "just friend" and "best friend" was not significant. In terms of gender, the probability of female crime is less than that of male crime. The authors note that people tend to choose partners of the same sex and that the more centrally located and cohesive the group, the more likely it is to commit criminal acts.
&emsp;
### In the analysis of the social level, the author mentioned two theories, one is Social disorganization theory and the other is Differential Social organization theory. The authors argue that over time, crime rates are higher in heterogeneous and disadvantaged communities because crime is caused by the breakdown of social disorder or informal social control within a community, and social disorder within a community, coupled with mobility, ethnic heterogeneity, and socioeconomic disadvantage, increases crime rates. “While this explanation is usually treated as a theory in itself, it can also be seen as a neighborhood-level version of the social control theory of individual criminality. A competing explanation proposes that delinquent and criminal peer influences are stronger in disadvantaged neighborhoods”. This is the author's explanation of the Differential Social Organization theory at the community level.
&emsp;
### The author believes that social network analysis can also be used to model criminal organizations. In his opinion, it is necessary to study criminal networks to comprehensively analyze criminal behaviors, because peer influence and neighborhood networks only involve the etiology of crimes, without including criminal organizations, causes, and results. “ In contrast to peer network studies, criminal network analyses are usually of whole networks rather than of personal or egocentric networks: that is, the networks are generally not conceptually centered on individuals, but comprise entire criminal groups, however, defined. ” the author states. Therefore, in the subsequent articles, the author used the network model to describe criminal activities and gangs from both dynamic and static aspects. 

&emsp;
# Analysis

### The author analyzes crime and social networks through personal networks, neighborhood networks, and criminal networks and he cites many theories and studies to support his views. I agree with most of them, but I still disagree with some of them。
&emsp;
### I really like the two theories the author mentioned on an individual level: Differential Association theory and Social control theory. When you study them separately, you would think they both make sense, but they contradict each other. Differential association theory holds that people's criminal behavior is influenced by external factors, such as friends, and parents. However, social control theory argues that we are all born with criminal behavior. It is only the surrounding environment that makes us control our impulse to commit crimes. When a person commits a crime, it is just "unleashing nature".
&emsp;
### This reminds me of two ancient Chinese people. One is Mencius, who was a philosopher, thinker, and educator in the Warring States Period (Richey, n.d.). And the other is Xunzi, who was a thinker, writer, and politician born in the same period (Britannica, n.d.). Both of them are representatives of Confucianism in the Warring States period.
&emsp;
### Mencius, from about 372 to 289 BC, proposed the idea that "Human nature is inherently good."(Zalta, 2019, September 6). This view reverberates deep into China. Even a thousand years later, Wang Yinglin wrote at the beginning of the Three Character Classic, "People at birth are naturally good”(The Three-Character Classic, 2022, January 9). Mencius believed that people are all good when they are born, but because of the different learning environments in the process of growing up, there is a difference between good and bad temperaments (Scarpari, n.d.).
&emsp;
### Xunzi's view of human nature is completely the opposite. He once proposed that "human nature is evil" in about 313-238 BC. “People are evil by nature, and their good deeds are man-made.” (Xunzi, n.d.). This is what Xun Zi wrote in Article Evil. He believed that people are born with evil nature, and their nature is to seek profit and desire. Everyone wants to eat when hungry, get warm when feeling cold, rest when feeling tired, love profit, and hate harm, which is what people are born with. Because everyone has the pursuit of material desire, is in the nature of its own, not to be learned and natural, it is the pursuit of material desire, that determines the evil of human nature (Scarpari, n.d.).
&emsp;
### The views of Mencius and Xunzi are contradictory, just like the Differential Association theory and Social control theory. I think they are similar. Differential Association theory refers to the idea that people are inherently good, while Social control theory refers to the idea that people are inherently evil. Compared with Differential Association theory and Social control theory, I am more familiar with the views of Mencius and Xunzi. Both of them are very reasonable. It is impossible to judge whether they are right or wrong. And ultimately, being good at evil is the criterion for criminal behavior. This is why I like these two theories.
&emsp;
### The individual network that the author talks about in the first part of the book is made up of Differential Association theory and Social control theory. In other words, when analyzing individual criminal behavior, both theories are indispensable. I support this view.
&emsp;
### I will use Texas shooting as an example. At least 21 people were killed after an 18-year-old man shot and killed his grandmother at their home, drove to Robb Elementary School, and opened fire on teachers and students (Casas, A., & Matza, M, 2022, May 26). 
&emsp;
### When we analyze the individual network of criminal suspects, only using one theory is not enough. Assuming we only use the Differential Association theory to analyze his individual networks, then what caused him to commit a crime is that someone around him "induced" him to commit a crime. That is, he himself does not have the consciousness of committing a crime, but there are people in the environment of life who commit a crime and cause him to commit a crime. 
&emsp;
### Assuming that only Social control theory is used to analyze his individual network, then he was born with such criminal consciousness, but the surrounding environment and people did not help him restrain such behavior. The two assumptions used to analyze his personal network are both wrongs because they are too limited and absolute. To analyze the individual network of a criminal suspect, we need to combine two theories, or even more, and study the reasons leading to his crime needs to be analyzed from various aspects, which is not only the individual network. However, as the police have not released too much information about the suspect, we do not know the reason for his crime, let alone analyze his individual network.
&emsp;
### Although the author cites many theories and makes a very reasonable statement. However, the analysis of the author only applies to active crimes and non-disease-related crimes. This is what I don't like about this article. To sum up the article, the author has been analyzing what leads a person to commit a crime and how the criminal network is formed from the beginning to the end. But what if the person was forced to commit the crime? The coercer does not commit the crime, but they do commit the crime (Team, 2019, April 29). In this case, the author notes that the theory is not applicable to the forced person. The author's article applies only to the person who coerces others into committing a crime. Certain mental illnesses do increase a person's risk of committing a crime. if the person who committed the crime was mentally ill, certain mental illnesses do increase a person's risk of committing a crime. He committed the crime because of a psychotic episode (Ghiasi, N., Azhar, Y., & Singh, J, 2022, January 15). It is useless to analyze the criminal's personal and social networks because neither of them caused him to commit the crime. In this article the author has limitations, but he did not explain this situation in the article, which is where I disagree.



&emsp;
# Conclusion

### In general, the thesis is clear Fully with strong evidence, and the authors assess the logical judgment reasoning, to prove their point of view I want to have a preliminary understanding of criminology, I recommend this article while I think this article has some limitations but does not mean it is not a good article I support the author's analysis of social network on criminal behavior from the perspective of the individual network, neighborhood network, and criminal network.
